In order for our data to be reproducible from the top, other users will need to install their own US Census API keys, which are provided at the following website: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. Once a key is obtained, this code will need to be ran: census_api_key(key, overwrite = FALSE, install = TRUE). More information can be found at https://rdrr.io/cran/tidycensus/man/census_api_key.html.
